Mackie Control Universal Overlay for Reaper
v 1.0 (September 1, 2009)
by Chris Doerman

This is my first stab at a MCU Overlay for Reaper - specifically for Klinke's fine 
MCU plugin (http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=41891).

I have included the template in MS Word DOC & XML formats and also in OpenOffice 
Writer ODT format. The template was authored in Open Office and was only briefly 
tested in MS Word.

To use the template, just open the format of your choice and edit the two largest 
tables at the top to reflect the commands you have assigned to the 8 "Global" keys. 
The template currently has room for each global key plus four modifier versions of 
the key (Shift, Option, Control, Alt) - for a total of 40 custom-assignable 
commands. Each modifier is color coded. The template currently includes the 
functions I am using for each button group.

Below the two large tables is a table with color coded labels for the four modifier 
keys. Below that is a series of tables the reflect the functions of Klinke's MCU 
plugin for other keys.

NOTE: some "hybrid" colors were used to represent cases where multiple modifiers 
need to be pressed. For example, if Shift (Yellow) and Option (Green) both need to 
be pressed a the same time, a yellow-green color is used. There are only a handful
of current example of this in Klinke's current MCU plugin.

Finally, a photo is also included to clarify where each table was intended to be 
printed, cut, and taped onto the MCU. The last table is simply a blank template as 
a starting point for any desired customizations.

Enjoy!
